## Linear independence and bases:
The #power of the concept of abstract vector spaces is that we can use the concepts / strategies / ideas we've learned for $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ in those new contexts (e.g. polynomials!)

A subset of V is a #basis if it is linearly independent and spans $V$. 

Unique representations: if B is a basis for $V$, then for every $\vec{v}\in V$, there is exactly one way to write $\vec{v}$ as a linear combination of the vectors in $B$. 

Basis theorem: If $V$ has a basis with $n$ vectors, then every basis of $V$ has exactly $n$ vectors. Any fewer doesn't span $V$, any more is linearly dependent.
